# arknights-poll

A ranking poll for Arknights operators using pairwise comparison. This project allows users to vote on which Arknights operator they think is better in a head-to-head comparison. The results are then used to generate a ranking of the operators based on user votes.

## Purpose and Functionality

The purpose of this project is to create a fun and interactive way for Arknights fans to rank their favorite operators. Users are presented with two operators and must choose which one they prefer. The votes are recorded and used to update the rankings. The project also includes a leaderboard that displays the top-ranked operators based on the votes.

## Hosting

The project is hosted at [arkpoll.nyansequitur.gay](https://arkpoll.nyansequitur.gay/).
